# Business Logic

1. An appointment has many clients.
2. You can either create an appointment for yourself or for your clients. There is a status column in the appointment.
3. An appointment has one trainer.

Then there's a session.

A session belongs to an appointment.
A session has many client sessions

  A client session belongs to session
